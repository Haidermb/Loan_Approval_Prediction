# Loan_Approval_prediction

This project aims to predict loan approval outcomes using Four different machine learning classifiers: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree,  Naive Bayes and SVC . 
The goal is to assist in automating the loan approval process and improving decision-making.

## Evaluation Metrics
The models are evaluated based on the following metrics:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
ROC-AUC

## Results 
As here we want optimal value for Type 1 error (FP rate) and Type 2 error (FN rate)  
Hence Naive Bayes is a optimal Choice with highest Accuracy and AUC
